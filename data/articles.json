      "content": "Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications. It provides many features out of the box including server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and incremental static regeneration (ISR).\n\nIn this article, we'll explore the core concepts that make Next.js such a popular choice for modern web development. From routing to data fetching, Next.js simplifies many aspects of building production-ready applications.\n\nThe framework's built-in optimizations help you create fast, SEO-friendly websites without the complexity of configuring build tools and optimizations manually.",

      "content": "Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) are two powerful data fetching strategies in Next.js, each serving different use cases.\n\nSSR generates pages on each request, making it perfect for highly dynamic content that changes frequently. Every time a user visits the page, the server renders it with the latest data.\n\nISR, on the other hand, combines the best of SSG and SSR. Pages are pre-built at build time but can be regenerated in the background when new requests come in after a specified revalidation period. This gives you the performance benefits of static generation with the freshness of server-side rendering.",
